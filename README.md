## How It Works

1. **Add Games**: Use `/addgame` to add games with their player count requirements and optional emoji
2. **Set Language** (optional): Use `/language` to choose your preferred language (English/Français)
3. **Vote**: Each week, players use `/vote` to open an interactive interface where they:
   - See all games in a live-updating table
   - Select games from a dropdown
   - Rate them 1-5 using another dropdown
   - Optionally restore votes from the previous week
4. **Availability**: 
   - Voting automatically marks you as available
   - Use `/unavailable` to mark yourself unavailable (votes are preserved)
   - Use `/available` to mark yourself available again (votes are restored)
5. **Results**: Use `/results` to see all compatible games based on votes and player count
   - Shows all games with pagination (if more than 10 games)
   - Only counts available players (not marked as unavailable)
   - Displays store links for each game
6. **Scheduling** (optional):
   - Use `/schedule` to schedule specific game nights
   - Use `/configreminder` to customize when reminders are sent
   - Use `/configgamenight` to set recurring game night schedules
7. **Automatic Workflow**:
   - **Reminder**: Bot sends reminder to vote (configurable per server, default: Sunday 8 PM)
   - **Wednesday 11:59 PM**: Bot automatically resets all votes and saves backup
   - **Daily 2 AM**: Bot cleans up old vote backups (30+ days) and log files (7+ days)

## Project Structure

The bot is organized into clear modules for maintainability:

### Core Module (`core/`)
Contains all core utilities and shared functionality:
- **`config.py`**: File paths and configuration constants
- **`data_manager.py`**: Data loading/saving (games, votes, config, schedules)
- **`helpers.py`**: Common helper functions (permissions, error messages)
- **`permissions.py`**: Permission checking utilities
- **`logger_config.py`**: Logging setup and configuration
- **`translations.py`**: Multi-language translation strings (English/French)

### Commands Module (`commands/`)
All Discord slash commands organized by functionality:
- **`game_commands.py`**: Game management (add, remove, update, list, emoji, roles)
- **`voting_commands.py`**: Voting commands (vote, myvotes, available, unavailable)
- **`results_commands.py`**: Results display command
- **`schedule_commands.py`**: Scheduling commands (schedule, schedules)
- **`config_commands.py`**: Server configuration (reminder, game night schedule)
- **`admin_commands.py`**: Admin-only commands (clear votes, sync, export/import)
- **`user_commands.py`**: User commands (language, help)

### Views Module (`views/`)
Discord UI components (modals, views, buttons):
- **`game_views.py`**: Game management UI (add/update/remove modals, list pagination)
- **`voting_view.py`**: Interactive voting interface
- **`results_view.py`**: Results pagination view

### Root Files
- **`bot.py`**: Main entry point - bot initialization and command registration
- **`scheduler.py`**: Scheduled tasks (reminders, vote resets, cleanup)

### Data Storage (`data/`)
- **`shared_games.json`**: Centralized game definitions (all servers)
- **`guilds/{guild_id}/`**: Per-server data
  - `games.json`: List of enabled game keys for this server
  - `votes.json`: Current votes for this server
  - `config.json`: Server configuration
  - `schedules.json`: Scheduled game nights
  - `votes_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.json`: Vote backups (auto-created)

### Logs (`logs/`)
- **`bot_YYYY-MM-DD.log`**: Daily log files (created at midnight, auto-deleted after 7 days)

## Data Storage

The bot uses a hybrid data architecture:

### Shared Games Database
- **`data/shared_games.json`**: Centralized database of all game definitions
  - Contains: id, name, min_players, max_players, emoji, store_links, tags, remote_play_together
  - All servers share this database for game details
  - Games are identified by unique keys (lowercase game names)

### Per-Server Data
The bot stores server-specific data in the `data/guilds/` directory:
- Each Discord server gets its own folder: `data/guilds/{server_id}/`
- **`games.json`** - List of game keys enabled on this server (references shared games)
- **`votes.json`** - Current votes, availability status, and language preferences (per server)
- **`config.json`** - Server configuration (reminder schedule, game night schedule, game management roles)
- **`schedules.json`** - Scheduled game nights with dates and descriptions
- **`votes_backup_YYYY-MM-DD.json`** - Automatic vote backups when votes are reset (per server)

**Important**: 
- Each server has its own list of enabled games (stored as keys in `games.json`)
- Game details (player counts, store links, emojis) are pulled from the shared database
- Each server has completely separate votes and configuration
- Users on different servers cannot see each other's games or votes

Log files are stored in the `logs/` directory:
- `bot_YYYY-MM-DD.log` - One log file per day (created at midnight)
- Old log files are automatically deleted after 7 days

## Example Workflow

1. **Setup** (one-time): Admin adds games:
   - `/addgame name:"Among Us" min_players:4 max_players:10 emoji:👻 store_links:"Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/945360"`
   - `/addgame name:"Astroneer" min_players:1 max_players:4 emoji:🚀`
   - Optionally configure game management roles: `/setgameroles @GameMaster`
   - Optionally configure reminder schedule: `/configreminder day:Friday hour:18 minute:0`

2. **Weekly Voting** (Sunday reminder or anytime):
   - Players use `/vote` to open the interactive interface
   - Select games from dropdown and rate them 1-5
   - Can restore previous week's votes with one click
   - Table updates automatically after each vote

3. **Game Night**: Someone runs `/results`
   - Bot shows: "5 players available"
   - All compatible games listed by score (with pagination if more than 10)
   - Recommended game highlighted
   - Store links displayed for each game

4. **Automatic Reset**: Wednesday at 11:59 PM
   - Bot saves current votes to `votes.old.YYYY-MM-DD.json`
   - Clears all votes for new voting period
   - Sends notification to server

5. **Maintenance** (automatic):
   - Daily cleanup of old vote backups (30+ days)
   - Daily cleanup of old log files (7+ days)
   - New log file created every day at midnight

## Troubleshooting

- **Bot not responding**: 
  - Make sure the bot is online and has proper permissions in your server
  - Check console output for errors
  - Review log files in `logs/` directory

- **Commands not showing**:
  - Wait a few minutes after starting the bot for commands to sync
  - Use `/sync` command (admin only) for instant updates
  - If still not working, check that the bot has `applications.commands` scope

- **Reminder not working**:
  - Check your server's reminder schedule with `/config`
  - Reminder schedule is configurable per server (default: Sunday 8 PM)
  - Make sure the bot is running continuously
  - Check logs for scheduler activity
  - Consider using a hosting service for 24/7 uptime

- **Vote table not updating**:
  - Make sure both game and rating are selected in the dropdowns
  - The table should auto-update after vote is saved
  - Try refreshing the `/vote` command

- **Log files not rotating**:
  - Log files are created at midnight each day
  - Ensure the bot is running at midnight for proper rotation
  - Old logs are automatically cleaned after 7 days

## Notes

- **Continuous Running**: The bot needs to be running 24/7 for scheduled tasks (reminders, resets, cleanup) to work
- **Hosting**: Consider hosting on a cloud service (Heroku, Railway, VPS, etc.) for reliable uptime

  - Use `/unavailable` to mark yourself unavailable (votes are preserved, not deleted)
  - Use `/available` to mark yourself available again (votes are restored)
  - Unavailable users are not counted in results or player count
- **Language Support**:
  - Each user can set their preferred language with `/language`
  - Available languages: English (en) and Français (fr)
